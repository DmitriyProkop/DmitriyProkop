I am a brand new software developer looking to learn the ins and outs of coding. I am currently looking to collaborate on beginner friendly Javascript code and would like to learn more coding languages to expand my repetoire. So far this journey has been a stressful and challenging endeavor, however that is what makes the process that much sweeter. 

I am looking for help to better my understanding of the loops concept. I would like to fully understand every aspect of this concept so that it would allow me to build a stronger foundation overall. Brick by brick houses are created, and I feel the same is true when it comes to writing code. The stronger the brick, the stronger of a foundation can be built. With furthering these skills, it would provide beneficial for myself and any future projects I will be a part of. 

Feel free to ask me any questions regardling professional and or personal life. I am a very open individual, and enjoy getting to know my colleagues, and the people who I will interact with. 

with that you can reach me by email 2 of which I use and check almost daily.

main one being: Dimaprokopyuk@yahoo.com
secondary: Dims.Prokopyuk@gmail.com

A little fun fact about me, is that I can speak two languages. I can both read and write (although slowly) Ukrainian and English. 
I do understand Russian but have a hard time speaking it. 

Please feel free to reach out about any questions or concerns.
